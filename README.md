Was testing around with os and subprocess, for some reason its not allowing the reading of a process out to a file, so you'll have to usage* > filename.   to be able to save the output when you use it. Had the errors spit out last as that's a indicator.

usage: python3 ProCheckt.py "programname" charamount

* If its another python program you can write "python3 programname" for programname just make sure its in quotations, and if its not working get your file path right.

set the char amount to whatever you like bigger than 1, too big causes some issues with matrix size operations if you don't set the list length yourself. Each character is handled Anonymously through Lambda with anonymity level variant on amount of chars within each list(matrix)

Check the saved log after its run to see if any of the times it ran went through any glitches. to set up a character gateway of what shouldn't be used in your programs.


Note: this does not check surrogate chars, future installations could include class gateways but I'll let you set that if you'd like




Using this can take a while, so be sure to get a coffee and watch a movie while you're waiting. Maybe buy a Blue Reptile skin backpack from my shop https://www.redbubble.com/i/backpack/Blue-reptile-Skin-by-ArtsAndCrypts/155105785.K1KHE

If you'd like to lower the amount of time, I'd recommend looking back at some of my multithreaded multiprocessing programs for asynchronous ways to exponentially increase speed of the program and lower run time. Though this ones way bugged out from people trying to stop its usage (It got into all of Amazon's Memcache) it's a good reference on getting that going https://github.com/777388/AWSMEMCACHE/blob/main/amazonmemcache.py  While this one showcases how to use a memory placement as a memory conflict zone to cause an electron collision https://github.com/777388/Blanket/blob/main/blanket good for understanding threading.

Using gdb you can set a break point to every time the lambda issuance comes along just so you can see if each triage(charamount) set together causes some sort of interaction. Paraphysic acoustics have been an interest of mine lately.

Possible usages: this could be set to check a matrices "[e, x, a, m, p, l, e]" containing a whole word against a dicionary through a Forest of Language trees containing every possible permutation up to an amount of chars given, to see if any combinations spark a response. Said forests of character trees can be created with one of my mass data programs. "We're not out of the Woods Yet". If things get nonsensical check against the forests of unusable language trees.

this could also save each response into a database of responses minus the character provided in mentioning the program, and then save which characters showcase the same responses, biggest job in that one will be targeting the character used in the response if reused throughout. May suggest a gateway of % difference in os.popen().read response

Ghidra could be used for targetting info pipeways with this program to see if any injections cause a programmatic malfunction or different response.
