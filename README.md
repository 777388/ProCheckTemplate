usage: python3 ProCheckt.py "programname*" charamount

* If its another python program you can write "python3 programname"

set the char amount to whatever you like bigger than 1, too big causes some issues with matrix size operations if you don't set the list length yourself. Each character is handled Anonymously through Lambda

Check the saved log after its run to see if any of the times it ran went through any glitches. to set up a character gateway of what shouldn't be used in your programs.


Note: this does not check surrogate chars, future installations could include class gateways but I'll let you set that if you'd like


Using gdb you can set a break point to every time the lambda issuance comes along just so you can see if each triage(charamount) set together causes some sort of interaction. Paraphysic acoustics have been an interest of mine lately.
