usage: python3 ProCheckt.py "programname*" charamount

* If its another python program you can write "python3 programname"

set the char amount to whatever you like bigger than 1, too big causes some issues with matrix size operations if you don't set the list length yourself. Each character is handled Anonymously through Lambda

Check the saved log after its run to see if any of the times it ran went through any glitches. to set up a character gateway of what shouldn't be used in your programs.


Note: this does not check surrogate chars, future installations could include class gateways but I'll let you set that if you'd like


Using gdb you can set a break point to every time the lambda issuance comes along just so you can see if each triage(charamount) set together causes some sort of interaction. Paraphysic acoustics have been an interest of mine lately.

Possible usages: this could be set to check a matrices "[e, x, a, m, p, l, e]" containing a whole word against a dicionary through a Forest of Language trees containing every possible permutation up to an amount of chars given, to see if any combinations spark a response. Said forests of character trees can be created with one of my mass data programs. "We're not out of the Woods Yet". If things get nonsensical check against the forests of unusable language trees.

this could also save each response into a database of responses minus the character provided in mentioning the program, and then save which characters showcase the same responses, biggest job in that one will be targeting the character used in the response if reused throughout. May suggest a gateway of % difference in os.popen().read response

Ghidra could be used for targetting info pipeways with this program to see if any injections cause a programmatic malfunction or different response.
